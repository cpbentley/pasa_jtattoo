# The JTattoo Project

JTattoo is a look and feel library for swing based applications. JTattoo consists of several different look and feels which may also improve your java application with an excellent user interface.

# Why The Fork? 

The pasa.cbentley.jtattoo package provides a JavaSkinManager for dynamically loading available skins.

In order to achieve dynamic discovery of look and feel along with their themes, I had to modify every JTattoo themes with a few methods.

I don't use Maven for it. So you will have to manually download it and link it.
